The reported statistics include cause of death, ranking, total deaths, crude rates, age-standardised rates and rate ratio. The data spans the period between 2012-2016 and is aggregated to Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) geographic areas from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).<br/><br/>\n\nMortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books are workbooks that contain recent deaths data for specific geographical areas, sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Mortality Database. They present various statistics related to deaths by all causes and leading causes of death by sex for each geographical area.<br/><br/>\n\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:\n<a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-death/mort-books/contents/mort-books\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - MORT Books</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note:\n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data.</li>\n<li>Cause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
